# Word Format Support Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Word document (.docx and .doc) format support for Doc Detective Resolver. Word documents are now automatically converted to Markdown and processed for test detection.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies
- Added `mammoth@1.11.0` for Word to Markdown conversion
- Added `docx@8.5.0` (dev dependency) for creating test Word documents

### 2. Code Changes

#### src/utils.js
- Imported `mammoth` library
- Added `convertWordToMarkdown()` function that:
  - Converts Word documents to Markdown using mammoth
  - Transforms mammoth's `__bold__` syntax to standard `**bold**` syntax
  - Returns the converted Markdown content
- Modified `parseTests()` function to:
  - Detect Word documents by file extension (.docx, .doc)
  - Convert Word documents to Markdown before processing
  - Use Markdown file type for processing converted content

#### src/config.js
- Added `word_1_0` file type definition with extensions: ["docx", "doc"]
- Added "word" to keyword versions mapping
- Modified `setConfig()` to automatically add "word" to default file types

### 3. Testing

#### src/word.test.js (new file)
- Tests for `convertWordToMarkdown()` function existence
- Configuration tests for Word file type registration
- Integration test for processing sample Word document

#### test/artifacts/sample-test.docx (new file)
- Sample Word document with bold text and links
- Used for integration testing

#### scripts/create-sample-word-doc.js (new file)
- Script to programmatically create test Word documents
- Uses `docx` library to generate sample documents

### 4. Documentation

#### docs/word-format-support.md (new file)
- Comprehensive documentation of Word format support
- Usage examples
- Feature descriptions
- Known limitations
- Configuration options

## How It Works

1. **File Detection**: When a .docx or .doc file is specified as input, it's recognized by the file qualification system
2. **Conversion**: The Word document is converted to Markdown using mammoth, with bold text converted from `__text__` to `**text**`
3. **Processing**: The converted Markdown is processed using the standard Markdown file type rules
4. **Test Detection**: All Markdown-based test detection features work, including:
   - Bold text detection for click/find actions
   - Hyperlink detection
   - Code block detection
   - HTML comment-style test specifications

## Test Results

All tests pass (36 total):
- ✓ Existing functionality preserved (31 tests)
- ✓ Word format function tests (3 tests)
- ✓ Integration test with sample Word document (1 test)

## Example Usage

```javascript
const { detectAndResolveTests } = require("doc-detective-resolver");

const results = await detectAndResolveTests({
  config: {
    input: "documentation.docx"
  }
});
```

## Limitations

1. Only simple bold formatting is reliably converted
2. Complex layouts (tables, multi-column) may not convert cleanly
3. Images are not currently processed
4. Word comments are not preserved

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future consideration:
- Support for italic text detection
- Table processing
- Image extraction and handling
- Custom style mapping
- .doc (Office 97-2003) format optimization
