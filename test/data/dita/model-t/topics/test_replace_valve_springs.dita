    <title>Testing and Replacing Valve Springs</title>
    <shortdesc>Test valve springs for weakness and replace if necessary to ensure proper engine
        operation.</shortdesc>

    <taskbody>
        <prereq>
            <p>Ensure the engine is in a condition where it can be safely operated for testing.</p>
        </prereq>
        <context>
            <p>Improperly seated valves may indicate weak or broken valve springs. While weak inlet
                springs have minimal impact, weak exhaust valve springs can cause significant
                performance issues including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Uneven engine action</li>
                <li>Engine lag</li>
                <li>Loss of compression</li>
                <li>Reduced explosion force</li>
            </ul>
        </context>
        <steps>
            <step>
                <cmd>Locate and remove the plate at the side of the cylinder that encloses the valve
                    springs</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Start the engine</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Insert a screwdriver between the coils of the spring while the engine is
                    running</cmd>
                <info>This action adds tension to the spring</info>
                <stepxmp>The screwdriver should fit securely between the coils without damaging
                    them</stepxmp>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Observe the engine's response to the added tension</cmd>
                <stepresult>If the engine speed increases, the spring is weak and requires
                    replacement</stepresult>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Replace the weak spring with a new one if necessary</cmd>
            </step>
        </steps>

        <result>
            <p>After replacing a weak spring, the valve should seat properly and engine performance
                should improve, eliminating uneven action and compression loss.</p>
