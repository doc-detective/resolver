            <note type="important">After extended service, if adjustment screws have been turned in
                significantly, consider installing new clutch discs rather than continuing to adjust
                the current ones.</note>
            <note type="warning">When working with small tools or objects near the transmission
                case, always attach them to a wire or cord. Items dropped into the transmission case
                are extremely difficult to retrieve without removing the transmission cover.</note>
