            <title>Throttle Control</title>
            <p>Speed variations are primarily achieved by adjusting the throttle opening. This
                fundamental mechanism allows drivers to respond to diverse road conditions by
                modulating the engine's power output.</p>

            <title>Gear Utilization</title>
            <p>The majority of driving scenarios can be navigated using high gear, which provides
                optimal performance for ordinary travel. Low gear serves a specific purpose:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Primary use: Generating initial vehicle momentum during start-up</li>
                <li>Limited application: Typically unnecessary for most driving conditions</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Clutch for Speed Modulation</title>
            <p>The clutch offers a nuanced method of speed control in challenging driving
                environments:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Technique</b>: "Slipping the clutch" by pressing the clutch pedal into
                    neutral</li>
                <li><b>Primary Applications</b>: <ul>
                        <li>Navigating crowded traffic</li>
                        <li>Maneuvering around corners</li>
                        <li>Temporarily reducing vehicle speed</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <title>Speed Control Principles</title>
            <p>Effective speed management combines multiple techniques, allowing drivers to maintain
                precise control over the vehicle's movement under varying road conditions. The key
                is understanding and smoothly applying these fundamental mechanical
                interactions.</p>
