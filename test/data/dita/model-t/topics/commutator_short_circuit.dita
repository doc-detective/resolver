    <title>Detecting Short Circuits in Commutator Wiring</title>
 
    <shortdesc>A short circuit in commutator wiring can be detected through specific symptoms
        including coil buzzing and engine performance issues. Understanding these indicators helps
        prevent potential damage to the engine.</shortdesc>

    <conbody>
        <p>A short circuit can occur when the insulation of primary wires (which run from the coil
            to commutator) becomes worn, exposing the copper wire. When this exposed wire contacts
            the engine pan or other metal parts, current leakage occurs, resulting in a short
            circuit.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Steady buzzing from one of the coil units</li>
                <li>Sudden engine lagging during operation</li>
                <li>Engine pounding due to premature explosion</li>
            </ul>

            <title>Safety Warning</title>
            <p>When a short circuit is suspected, avoid cranking the engine downward against
                compression. This action can cause a dangerous kickback due to the short circuit
                condition.</p>
