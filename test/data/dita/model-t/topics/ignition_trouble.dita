    <title>Identifying Ignition Problems</title>
 
    <shortdesc>Irregular engine exhaust sounds, particularly uneven sputtering and banging, indicate
        potential ignition problems that require immediate attention to prevent engine
        damage.</shortdesc>

            <title>Warning Signs</title>
            <p>Key indicators of ignition problems include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Uneven sputtering from the exhaust</li>
                <li>Banging sounds from the exhaust</li>
                <li>Irregular cylinder explosions</li>
                <li>Complete failure of cylinder firing</li>
            </ul>

            <title>Importance of Immediate Action</title>
            <p>Continued misfiring can result in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Engine damage</li>
                <li>Deterioration of the entire mechanical system</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <title>Best Practices</title>
            <p>For proper engine maintenance and operation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Listen for a soft, steady purr from the exhaust - this indicates proper
                    operation</li>
                <li>Address problems immediately when detected</li>
                <li>Stop and repair issues when possible rather than continuing to drive</li>
            </ul>
