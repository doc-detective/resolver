            <title>Common Valve Issue: Carbon Deposits</title>
            <p>Valves are prone to accumulating carbon deposits over time, which can significantly
                impact engine performance:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Carbon builds up on valve seats</li>
                <li>Deposits prevent valves from closing properly</li>
                <li>Improper valve closure allows compressed gases to escape</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Performance Implications</title>
            <p>Carbon-related valve issues can lead to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduced engine power</li>
                <li>Uneven engine operation</li>
                <li>Decreased overall engine efficiency</li>
            </ul>

            <title>Diagnosing Valve Problems</title>
            <p>Indicators that valves may need attention:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lack of resistance when slowly turning the engine</li>
                <li>Noticeable performance drop in one or more cylinders</li>
                <li>Reduced compression in specific engine cylinders</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Valve Maintenance Recommendations</title>
            <p>To ensure optimal engine performance:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Periodically re-grind valves to ensure proper seating</li>
                <li>Clean carbon deposits from valve seats</li>
                <li>Inspect valves during routine engine maintenance</li>
            </ol>
            <note type="important">The "life" of the engine significantly depends on proper valve
                maintenance and seating.</note>
