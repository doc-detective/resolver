            <title>Break-In Period Significance</title>
            <p>A new machine requires more careful attention during its first few days of operation
                compared to after the parts have become thoroughly "worked in." The approach to
                early maintenance directly impacts the car's long-term performance and
                reliability.</p>

            <title>Fundamental Maintenance Principles</title>
            <p>Effective new car maintenance revolves around several key concepts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Careful Operation</b>: Driving slowly and methodically during the initial
                    period helps ensure the most satisfactory service in the long term.</li>
                <li><b>Proactive Inspection</b>: Regular and thorough checking of the vehicle's
                    mechanical components prevents potential issues from developing.</li>
                <li><b>Immediate Attention</b>: Addressing any repairs or adjustments as soon as
                    they are discovered minimizes the risk of more significant problems.</li>
            </ul>

            <title>Owner's Maintenance Responsibility</title>
            <p>While manufacturers aim to deliver vehicles in optimal mechanical condition, the
                ongoing maintenance becomes the driver's responsibility. This involves:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensuring adequate oil and water levels before operation</li>
                <li>Checking for unnecessary play in wheels</li>
                <li>Verifying the tightness of all bolts and nuts</li>
                <li>Promptly addressing any mechanical adjustments</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Rationale for Proactive Maintenance</title>
            <p>Consistent, immediate attention to minor maintenance needs can prevent:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unexpected delays during travel</li>
                <li>Potential roadside accidents</li>
                <li>Premature wear of vehicle components</li>
            </ul>
